# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 11

## 1 Introduction

We are developing an Android mobile application for a ‘Phrase Guessing Game’ which is a variation of ‘Wheel of Fortune’. This app enables interested Users to create/play Puzzles and Tournaments, View statistics for each Puzzle/Tournament and keep track of and continue incomplete tournaments.

## 2 Process Description

The ‘Phrase Guessing Game’ will be developed using the Unified Software Process. As a result out development process will be tightly related to the UML, use case driven, Architecture Centric, Iterative and Incremental. In each iteration team will involve in Business modeling and requirements, Design and Analysis, Implementation, testing, Deployment phases. A set of documents and artifacts will be generated as a part of this development process and they will be updated with more details and modifications for each deliverable.
