# Test Plan

**Author**: Team11

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Our testing strategy will focus on three main areas: UI Testing, Instrument Testing and Unit Testing as described in detail below.

* Classes should be developed in such a manner that unit tests CAN (and should) be written. This means striving for low dependency across classes and creating modular interfaces. Any classes that can be unit tested will be. Unit tests should be automatable.
* Collection classes or groups of classes that compose specific subsystems will be subject to integration tests. Integration tests will not be implemented for purely contrived subsystems. This means that we will primarily focus on testing subsystems that will exist in the 'Wheel of Fortune' application and no more. Integration tests should be automatable.
* We have decided to neglect writing a full system test in an automative form. All full system level tests will be done in the manual QA testing process. This does not mean that these tests will not be recorded. Specific step by step instructions will be provided for testing specific use cases.
* UI tests are slow in general as we have to load the application on to an emulator but an automated UI test using tools such as Espresso, UI automator will enable us to identify errors that may have not captured through unit tests, system level tests and integration tests.

To some degree, all team members will be responsible for testing different aspects of the project. It is recommended that a different engineer be responsible for testing a newly authored code. This rule does not have to be strictly followed, but should be viewed as a best practice.

### 1.2 Test Selection

Both our unit tests and our integration tests will be written in the 'white' box format. In both cases the developer writing the test case should consider creating workflows (diagrams or otherwise) to visualize which code paths are followed and when. Upon understanding these various code paths, it is the developer's responsibility to get a reasonable amount of code coverage. 100% code coverage in automated testing is an admiral goal, but sometimes a non-functional one.

Our system level test will be done more from the black box perspective. There will be a listing of tests (i.e. use cases) that should be regularly checked with new builds of the project. Additionally the team will be responsible for creating new tests as the project develops. This means testing expected behavior of the application.  If, at any point, the tester discovers a particular workflow that does not produce an expected result (aka a bug), that workflow will be added to the use case listing.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

To verify that the tests we create meet the minimum standard of quality for this application we will use a combination of both functional and structural test coverage. At the unit test level we will keep track of the structural coverage at the minimum. Additionally, the test writer may additionally write functional tests at the unit test level, if the test makes sense.

At the integration test level, we will focus primarily on the functional coverage of the subsystems. Since the unit tests will cover the structural coverage of the code, we do not need to create tests for that at this level. However, if the test writer decides structural coverage is needed at this level as well, adding tests in that domain is satisfactory.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs and enhancement requests were handled using GitHub Issues for the project ([Issues][076fe412]). We tracked all the issues found in the app or app enhancement needs here. The same procedure will be followed for the upcoming deliverables and releases of the Application. Issues we found so far and tracked with the help of 'github issue tracking' are as follows.

|Issue|                            Issue Title                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Status |

Currently, the application only subtracts $300 from the prize value when the guess is correct.  Reproduction: Launch app -> Login ->  Select Play Puzzle ->  Increase the score enough to have more than $300 ->  Buy a vowel that is incorrect - the prize value will not be decremented | Closed   |
|[#4][076fe422]| Typo in getPlayableTournamentsForUser method               | Not a big issue. In TournamentManager.java in getPlayableTournamentsForUser there is a typo of one of the local variables.The name is ownedPuzzle instead of ownedPuzzle.Repo:Open TournamentManager.javaNavigate to getPlayableTournamentsForUserSee boolean ownedPuzzle                                                                                | Closed   |
|[#5][076fe423]| Wrong Error Message when username is blank at registration | When a username is not provided by the user during registration, the error message is "Sorry, that user already exists". Should change to something like "Please enter username".Also, right now we can register as long as we enter username. The project spec implied but didn't say clearly that firstname, lastname, email are required fields.      | Closed   |
|[#7][076fe425]| Create Tournament Activity Title Misspelled                | Reproduction: Launch appLogin -> Click Create Tournament -> Look at page title                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Closed   |
|[#10][076fe428]| Puzzles are shown by their phrase | when puzzles are listed for solve tournament operation they are displayed by phrase itself. where we show the phrase to the player before start solving.

|[#9][076fe427]| Manual Test - Tournament should consist of 1-5 puzzles                | Right now we can add more than 5 puzzles into a Tournament and according to the requirement 10.a Tournament can have 1-5 puzzles.Test steps: create a player1 -> create 6 puzzles -> create a Tournament and select all 6 puzzles for the tournament with a unique name -> See if it is accepted  | Closed   |
|[#11][076fe429]| Game should end with $0 when the remaining wrong guesses count goes negative | According to the Requirements minimum guesses allowed are between 0 and 10. Right now we can select 0 and 10 as maximum guesses.But  in our App when the maximum wrong guesses allowed is set to 0 for a Puzzle it automatically completes and doesn't let the player to play it. I think game should end with $0 when the remaining wrong guesses count goes negative. Test Steps: -> create player1 -> select create puzzle -> select max guesses - 0 -> create player 2 -> select the puzzle create by player1 -> puzzle is displayed and doesn't let the player2 to make any guesses and terminates right away by displaying a message that player2 is lost | Closed   |
|[#12][076fe42a]| Empty string is allowed as the Username | Right now an empty String is allowed as a valid username. It would be an enhancement if we restrict to have more characters in the username | Closed   |
|[#13][076fe42b]| First Name, Last Name and email fields can be empty | As of now First Name, Last Name and email fields can be empty when creating a new player. It would be an enhancement if we force the User to fill them. | Closed   |
|[#15][076fe42d]| Application Loading Issue | Have to uninstall and reinstall the app every time we open it in Android Studio | Closed   |
|[#14][076fe42c]| create Puzzle - can't have numeric characters only | As of now we can have only numeric or alphanumeric characters in a Puzzle phrase. Which would be an enhancement if we enforce to have at least a single letter in a phrase. Reproduction : create player1 ->  Select "Create Puzzle" -> enter a phrase with only numeric and/or non-alphanumeric characters | Not required   |



### 1.5 Technology

Currently, the only planned testing technology are JUnit. If the project proves to need additional UI testing Espresso tests will be implemented.

## 2 Test Cases

Our Test Plan consists of both manual and automated Testing. Test cases will be developed as follows for each UseCase. Automated Instrumentation Test Cases can be found in AndroidTest directory.
