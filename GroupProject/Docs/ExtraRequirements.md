Additional requirements not captured in other documents that we considered in our design: 
* Adaptability - while this application may not grow much outside of this team, making the components clean allows of modularity (and thus adaptability). 
* Maintainability - making sure the design is clearly documented and intuitive means that the project should be easy to maintain. 
* Extensibility - this one kind of goes along with Adaptability. Because the components are compartmentalized, we should be able to add more interfaces/components in the future if the purpose of the application should change. 
* Developer Efficacy/Iterativeness - this project design is meant to be iterative; the architecture itself is designed such that different areas can be developed in tandem. These means we can be more effective in our development cycles. 
* Documentation - since we have made initial documentation, moving forward this team will need to maintain/display the current condition of the system.
